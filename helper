1) try INSERT in local bd
1.1) change connection parameters just in 1 place -> just one connection opening -> create class
1.2) try on simplest -> to the same:
int
character car[]
1.3) why it isn't saved? -> find logs -> find NORMAL instruction
failed - can't create file -> google error
can't start as user -> another instruction step
turned off -> find another instruction
----------------------------
daddy's advice -> don't need logs
1) try to send the same query in query tool in pgadmin -> pgadmin added ->
2) if sent -> check _cursor.execute() function -> fixed !!
